  "readme": "# GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)\n\n#### Ultra high-performance, professional-grade animation for the modern web\n\nGSAP is a JavaScript library for high-performance HTML5 animations that work in **all** major browsers. No other library delivers such advanced sequencing, reliability, API efficiency, and tight control while solving real-world problems for animators on over 2.5 million sites. GSAP can animate *any* numeric property of *any* JS object, not just CSS properties.\n\n### Getting started video\n\n[![Getting started video](http://img.youtube.com/vi/tMP1PCErrmE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMP1PCErrmE)\n\nThink of GSAP as the Swiss Army Knife of animation. It animates anything JavaScript can touch (CSS properties, canvas library objects, SVG, generic objects, whatever) and solves countless browser inconsistencies, all with blazing speed (up to 20x faster than jQuery), including automatic GPU-acceleration of transforms. See the <a href=\"http://greensock.com/why-gsap/\">\"Why GSAP?\"</a> article for details. Most other libraries only animate CSS properties. Plus, their sequencing abilities and runtime controls pale by comparison. Simply put, GSAP is the most robust high-performance animation library on the planet, which is probably why Google recommends it for JS-based animations and every major ad network excludes it from file size calculations. Unlike monolithic frameworks that dictate how you structure your apps, GSAP completely flexible; sprinkle it wherever you want.\n\nThis is the public repository for GreenSock's JavaScript tools like <a href=\"http://greensock.com/gsap/\" target=\"_blank\">GSAP</a> and <a href=\"http://greensock.com/draggable/\" target=\"_blank\">Draggable</a>. \"GSAP\" describes all of the animation-related tools which include TweenLite, TweenMax, TimelineLite, TimelineMax, various plugins (like CSSPlugin for animating CSS properties of DOM elements), extra easing functions, etc. \n\n### Resources\n\n* <a href=\"http://greensock.com/gsap/\">GSAP home page</a>\n* <a href=\"http://greensock.com/get-started-js/\">Getting started guide</a>\n* <a href=\"http://greensock.com/examples-showcases\">Examples &amp; showcases</a>\n* <a href=\"http://greensock.com/why-gsap/\">Why GSAP?</a> (a practical guide for developers)\n* <a href=\"http://greensock.com/docs/#/HTML5/GSAP/\">Full documentation</a>\n* <a href=\"http://greensock.com/draggable/\">Draggable demo</a>\n* <a href=\"http://greensock.com/svg-tips/\">Animating SVG with GSAP</a>\n* <a href=\"http://greensock.com/jquery-gsap-plugin/\">jQuery plugin</a>\n* <a href=\"http://greensock.com/club/\">Club GreenSock</a> (get access to bonus plugins and tools not in this repository)\n* css-tricks.com article: <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/myth-busting-css-animations-vs-javascript/\">Myth Busting: CSS Animations vs. JavaScript</a>\n* css-tricks.com article about how <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/svg-animation-on-css-transforms/\">GSAP solves cross-browser SVG animation challenges</a>\n\n### CDN\n```html\n<script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/1.19.1/TweenMax.min.js\"></script>\n```\nClick the green \"Download GSAP\" button at <a href=\"http://greensock.com/?download=GSAP-JS\">http://greensock.com</a> for more options.
